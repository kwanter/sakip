# Admin Role System - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive admin role system for the SAKIP (Sistem Akuntabilitas Kinerja Instansi Pemerintah) application. The admin role will provide full, unrestricted access to all application features while maintaining security through proper role-based access control (RBAC).

The admin role system ensures that authorized administrators can manage all aspects of the application, including user management, system configuration, and all operational modules, while maintaining a secure and scalable permission architecture.

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.2 Current Permissions
- `manage_settings`: Admin-only permission for system configuration
- `manage_programs`: Program management permission
- `manage_kegiatans`: Activity management permission

### 2.3 Existing Authorization Implementation
- Policy-based authorization using Laravel Policies
- Blade directives for role-based UI rendering (`@role`, `@anyrole`, `@permission`)
