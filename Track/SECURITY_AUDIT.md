# Security Audit Findings

This document outlines the findings of the security audit and the fixes that have been implemented.

## Summary

The security audit focused on identifying and resolving permission and role-related issues in the SAKIP application. The audit covered the following areas:

*   Access control implementation
*   Role-based permissions
*   Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
*   Least privilege principles
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Findings and Fixes

### 1. Redundant Middleware

*   **Finding:** The application had custom `PermissionMiddleware` and `RoleMiddleware` that were redundant after migrating to the `spatie/laravel-permission` package.
*   **Fix:** The redundant middleware files were deleted, and the middleware aliases in `bootstrap/app.php` were updated to use the middleware provided by the Spatie package.

### 2. Insecure Routes

*   **Finding:** The SAKIP web and API routes lacked specific role or permission middleware, posing a security risk.
*   **Fix:** The `web_sakip.php` and `api_sakip.php` route files were updated to include the `permission:view-dashboard` middleware, restricting access to authorized users.

### 3. Incorrect Permission Usage

*   **Finding:** The `AdminController`, `UserPolicy`, and `admin/dashboard.blade.php` view were using custom permissions that were not defined in the `RolesAndPermissionsSeeder`.
*   **Fix:** The `AdminController`, `UserPolicy`, and `admin/dashboard.blade.php` view were updated to use the correct permissions defined in the `RolesAndPermissionsSeeder`.

### 4. Insecure Navigation

*   **Finding:** The main navigation in `layouts/app.blade.php` did not have any permission checks, allowing all authenticated users to see all navigation links.
*   **Fix:** The `layouts/app.blade.php` file was updated to use `@can` directives to show and hide navigation links based on the user's permissions.

## Conclusion

The security audit has been completed, and all identified issues have been resolved. The application is now more secure and adheres to the principle of least privilege.
