Final Verification Report

Date: 2025-10-13
Environment: macOS, Laravel app under /Users/macbook/Developer/php/sakip

Summary
- Feature tests run and passed (AppFeaturesTest).
- Both Laravel dev servers are running and responsive on 8000 and 8001.
- Manual UI validation confirms normalized status labels and currency formatting across key pages.
- Database indexing present for common filters.
- Documentation updated and consolidated under docs/.

Feature Tests
Command: php artisan test --filter=AppFeaturesTest
Results:
- PASS Tests\Feature\AppFeaturesTest
  ✓ protected routes redirect guest to login (0.28s)
  ✓ authenticated user can access program routes (0.17s)
  ✓ policy allows crud for authenticated user (0.03s)
  ✓ instansi show uses eager counts without n plus one (0.02s)
- Tests: 4 passed (21 assertions)
- Duration: 0.59s

Server Status
- Server A: php artisan serve (auto) → http://127.0.0.1:8001
  • Recent requests observed: /login, /js/helpers.js, /@vite/client
- Server B: php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000 → http://127.0.0.1:8000
  • Recent requests observed: /instansi/create, /login, /js/helpers.js, /@vite/client
- Previews opened for validation:
  • http://127.0.0.1:8001/program
  • http://127.0.0.1:8001/kegiatan

Manual UI Validation
Pages validated:
- Program list and forms
  • Status labels: draft, aktif, selesai (normalized display)
  • Currency inputs and displays use shared formatting helper
- Kegiatan list and forms
  • Status labels: draft, berjalan, selesai, tunda ("Non-aktif" removed → "Tunda")
  • Currency inputs and displays use shared formatting helper
- Indikator Kinerja
  • Retains domain-specific status: aktif / nonaktif (no change to schema)
Notes:
- Badge/display checks and select options reflect normalized labels.
- No stray "Non-aktif" remains in Kegiatan or Program views.

Database Indexes
- Composite index added to programs for common filtering:
  • File: database/migrations/2025_10_13_121217_add_composite_index_to_programs_table.php
  • Index: programs_status_tahun_instansi_idx on (status, tahun, instansi_id)
- Built-in indexes present in sessions, jobs, and related tables per framework defaults.

Documentation
- Updated and present:
  • docs/implementation-summary.md
  • docs/technical-documentation.md
  • docs/setup-deployment.md
  • docs/code-quality-standards.md

Verification Checklist
- Authentication middleware implemented → Verified via test: guest routes redirect to login
- Authorization policies created → Verified via test: policy allows CRUD for authenticated user
- N+1 query issues fixed → Verified via test around Instansi eager counts
- Currency formatting standardized → Verified in Program and Kegiatan views using helpers.js
- Status display normalized → Verified badges and selects for Program/Kegiatan; Indikator/Instansi remain domain-specific
- Database indexes added → Verified composite index on programs table
- JavaScript helpers centralized → Verified shared helpers in public/js/helpers.js
- Comprehensive documentation created → Verified docs present and updated

Key Files Touched (high level)
- public/js/helpers.js (currency formatting & shared utilities)
- resources/views/program/*.blade.php (forms, labels, helpers integration)
- resources/views/kegiatan/*.blade.php (forms, labels, helpers integration)
- resources/views/indikator-kinerja/*.blade.php (unchanged schema; validated displays)
- database/migrations/* (new composite index; existing framework indexes)
- docs/*.md (four documentation files finalized)

Recommendations
- Consider adding feature tests for currency formatting behavior on form submissions.
- Add smoke tests for status label rendering across list/detail pages.
- Monitor performance around Program/Kegiatan queries with the new composite index in production.

Conclusion
All requested implementations are verified. Tests pass, servers are healthy, UI conforms to normalized labels and currency formatting, indexes are in place, helpers are centralized, and documentation is complete.
