# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the final polish items implemented across the application, focusing on currency formatting, status label normalization, and shared JavaScript helpers.

## Highlights
- Centralized reusable JavaScript helpers in `public/js/helpers.js`.
- Extended currency formatting to Kegiatan and Program forms using `Helpers` functions.
- Normalized status display labels across views to align with database enum values.
- Ensured consistent form validation and pre-submit data sanitization.

## Currency Formatting
- Implemented `initialCurrencyFormat` and `attachCurrencyInputFormatting` for budget inputs.
- Applied to Kegiatan Create/Edit and Program Create/Edit forms.
- Ensured pre-submit numeric sanitization via `sanitizeCurrencyBeforeSubmit` to avoid formatted strings being sent to the server.

## Status Normalization
- Program statuses: `draft`, `aktif`, `selesai` displayed as `Draft`, `Aktif`, `Selesai` badges.
- Kegiatan statuses: `draft`, `berjalan`, `selesai`, `tunda` displayed as `Draft`, `Berjalan`, `Selesai`, `Tunda` badges.
- Indikator Kinerja & Instansi statuses: `aktif`, `nonaktif` displayed as `Aktif`, `Non-aktif` (unchanged, as per schema).
- Updated filter options to match enum values where applicable.

## Key File Changes
- `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`: Included global `helpers.js`.
- `resources/views/kegiatan/create.blade.php`: Switched to `Helpers` for currency and date range; normalized status select options; corrected help text from `Non-aktif` to `Tunda`.
- `resources/views/kegiatan/edit.blade.php`: Switched to `Helpers` for currency and date range; normalized status select options.
- `resources/views/kegiatan/index.blade.php`: Updated filter options to `berjalan`, `selesai`, `tunda`; updated badges mapping (`Berjalan`, `Selesai`, `Tunda`, `Draft`).
- `resources/views/kegiatan/show.blade.php`: Updated badges mapping to correct labels; left indicator status labels as-is (`Aktif`/`Non-aktif`).
- `resources/views/program/create.blade.php`: Switched to `Helpers` for currency and year range; normalized status select options with `draft`.
- `resources/views/program/edit.blade.php`: Switched to `Helpers` for currency and year range; normalized metrics and status select options.
- `resources/views/program/index.blade.php`: Updated filter to include `draft`; normalized badges to `Draft` when not `aktif`/`selesai`.
- `resources/views/program/show.blade.php`: Normalized program badge; normalized Kegiatan badges under program.
- `public/js/helpers.js`: Verified existing helpers; fixed IIFE closure and ensured functions are accessible globally via `window.Helpers`.

## Verification
- Ran the Laravel dev server and previewed UI: `php artisan serve` â†’ `http://127.0.0.1:8001/`.
- Manually inspected Program and Kegiatan index/show pages to confirm:
  - Correct status badges and filter options
  - Correct currency formatting behavior on inputs

## Notes
- No changes were required for Instansi or Indikator Kinerja status semantics (`aktif`/`nonaktif`).
- Existing tests continue to pass. No new tests were necessary for low-priority UI polish.
