## 1. 🚨 Critical Findings (Untestable Blockers)
_List any remaining critical ambiguities or untestable constraints that must be resolved to reach the 80-point threshold. If none, write "None"._

- **Requirement / Section:** "{Quote exact text}"
  - **Testability Gap:** {Explain why this cannot be automatically verified in a RED test}
  - **Proposed Seam:** {Target public interface boundary}

## 2. 🧩 Resolved Items & Pre-Agreed Boundaries
_List the ambiguities, edge cases, and assumptions successfully resolved during this session through Heavy Lifting._

- **Original Ambiguity:** "{Quote exact text}"
  - **Resolution & Boundary:** {Agreed concrete metric, A/B choice, or BDD scenario}
  - **Target Seam:** {e.g. Unit: OrderService.validate() or Integration: POST /api/v1/orders}

## 3. ⚠️ Assumed / Auto-Resolved / Out of Scope (The 20% Tail)
_List minor edge cases or technical details that were automatically resolved using the AI's technical recommendations because the user chose to PROCEED._

- **Scenario / Question:** {Describe minor edge case}
  - **Handling:** `[Assumed / Auto-Resolved]` or `[Assumed / Out of Scope]` - {The AI's recommended technical resolution}

## 4. 📝 Next Steps
- If Score < 80: Author agent must remediate the document to resolve Section 1 blockers.
- If Score >= 80: Proceed to the next SDLC phase.
- If new canonical terms were agreed upon, update `CONTEXT.md`.
- If hard-to-reverse architectural decisions were made, document in `docs/adr/`.
